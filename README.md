### 𝐓𝐖𝐈𝐓𝐓𝐄𝐑 𝐓𝐖𝐄𝐄𝐓𝐒 𝐒𝐔𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐃𝐀𝐋 𝐈𝐃𝐄𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐃𝐄𝐓𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐔𝐒𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐃𝐄𝐄𝐏 𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆 (https://github.com/deepthi16032002/Suicidal-Ideation-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning)
The rise in technological advancements and Social Networking Sites (SNS) made people more engaged in their virtual lives.
Research has revealed that people feel more comfortable posting their feelings, including suicidal thoughts,
on SNS than discussing them through face-to-face settings due to the social stigma associated with mental health .
Many suicidal deaths can be prevented by understanding how people communicate their distress related thoughts. 
Early understanding of the risk factors and warning signs can decrease the threshold for suicide and help prevent many deaths. 
This Project aims to develop a system that can detect suicidal ideation on Twitter tweets using DL models.
In this project we trained several Deep learning models such as LSTM(Long Short -Term Memory), GRU(Gated Recurrent unit),andCNN(ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork)
